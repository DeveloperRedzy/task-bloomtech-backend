## 🛠 **TECHNICAL IMPLEMENTATION DETAILS**

### Database Design Decisions

1. **PostgreSQL Choice**:
   - ACID compliance for data integrity
   - Excellent JSON support for flexible data
   - Robust indexing and query optimization
   - Production-proven reliability

2. **Prisma ORM Benefits**:
   - Type-safe database access
   - Automatic migration generation
   - Excellent TypeScript integration
   - Built-in connection pooling

3. **Schema Optimizations**:
   - Strategic indexes on timestamp fields for query performance
   - Foreign key constraints for data integrity
   - Optimized for read-heavy workloads with timestamp queries
   - Support for multiple entries per day

### API Design Principles

1. **RESTful Design**:
   - Consistent URL patterns (`/api/auth/*`, `/api/work-entries/*`)
   - Proper HTTP status codes
   - Standard HTTP methods
   - Resource-based endpoints

2. **Error Handling**:
   - Consistent error response format
   - Meaningful error messages
   - Proper HTTP status codes
   - Security-conscious error disclosure

3. **Data Validation**:
   - Input validation at API boundary
   - Runtime type checking with Zod
   - Sanitization for XSS prevention
   - Business rule validation (timestamp ranges, duration limits)

### Security Architecture

1. **Authentication Flow**:

   ```
   User Registration → Password Hashing → JWT Generation
   User Login → Password Verification → JWT + Refresh Token
   API Request → JWT Validation → Route Access
   Token Refresh → Refresh Token Validation → New JWT
   ```

2. **Authorization Model**:
   - User can only access their own data
   - JWT contains minimal user information
   - No role-based access (single user type)
   - Resource-level permissions

3. **Security Layers**:
   - Tiered rate limiting at API gateway
   - Input validation and sanitization
   - SQL injection prevention via ORM
   - XSS prevention through output encoding
   - Account lockout protection
